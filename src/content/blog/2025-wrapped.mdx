PS: This year was not too good for me :) and I will keep this blog very short.

So this year was very bettersweet for me.

- made projects from scratch.
- did network programming.
- went through peak burnout phase.
- wasted 3-4 months doing absolutely nothing.
- finally got out of that phase
- made programming fun again
- built some projects (that i like)


## DECEMBER (BEST MONTH)

- fully recovered from the burnout phase
- made betterwrite with [@lirena00](https://x.com/@lirena00)
- it got 130+ upvotes on both 
- got over 1k users
- went to bangalore and met some cool folks

Yeah that's it. At the end i would like to say, everything will work out. it's just compounding rn.
just do things, not to impress others but you. If you feel satisfied you are already good.

And yeah not every day, month or year can be a W for you, but its important to take action on it asap rather than crying and
regreting over it : ) You are already a winner

~ have a prosperous year, Thanks goat
