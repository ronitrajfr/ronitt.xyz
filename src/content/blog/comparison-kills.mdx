import Link from "../../components/Link.vue";
import Code from "../../components/Code.vue";
import { createHeading } from "../../components/Heading";

export const components = {
  a: Link,
  code: Code,
  h1: createHeading("h1"),
  h2: createHeading("h2"),
  h3: createHeading("h3"),
};


## Phase 1

Okay, so I guess it all started during August. I was very active on Twitter. I was so fascinated to see the crazy things people used to do.
But after all, it’s just a social media app, and I built an addiction. Every day I used to do something new, in a whole different field.
For example: First day I saw a guy building an operating system, second day I saw a guy making very beautiful micro-interactions.
At first, I was so fascinated to see them, but then it became the reason I lost my curiosity.

I started looking for different things. Yeah, just looking, doing nothing at all. I started to explore every other field. Programming started to become a thing that I needed to prove. It was a fun activity for me, but now it wasn’t.
I started to talk to everyone, started thinking too much about programming, and ultimately I burned out.
And yeah, I can say that FOMO made me lose curiosity.

## Phase 2

I believed that in order to overcome this, I should pick a niche and go blindly deep on it.
So what did I do? I started talking to a lot of my friends about this and started asking which field to choose.
Some said to do ML, some said low-level, backend, DevOps, WebRTC, frontend, low-level, and so on…
And I literally spent one month figuring out which field is for me, and guess what I realized?
I still didn’t figure it out. HUSH :(

But I realized that I forgot to ask one question :p

## Phase 3 (current phase)

I forgot to ask what I want. I lost authenticity, curiosity, and constantly burned out.
And then I closed everything for a week. Every legit thing. I just focused on my academics. And while solving a math problem, I went into a deep thought.
Apparently, I refound myself. I realized this is not what I want. My goal was to have fun, to do whatever I want.
I am not a guy who can go deep on things without having a project in my mind. For example: I am going to build my own Git in Rust. And why? Firstly, I want to learn how Git works internally, and secondly, I like Rust.
I am doing it for myself because I am genuinely interested.
I have stopped other people from influencing me. I do what I want to do, the way I want it to be.

After all, if you are going through the same thing, I would like to say: It’s okay to be behind. It’s okay to be a newbie, and it’s the best superpower you can have.
Eventually, you will reach there. Stop comparing yourself. Work hard. Enjoy life to the fullest, and it’s very important to take holidays even from what you love to do :)
Comparison really kills.

~ Thank you!
